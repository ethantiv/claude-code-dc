# DevContainer Environment Variables Example
# 
# This file serves as a template for .devcontainer/.env
# Copy this file to .devcontainer/.env for local development

# GitHub Personal Access Token (required for local development)
# Get your token from: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Required permissions: repo, workflow
# GH_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Note for GitHub Codespaces users:
# - This file is automatically created as empty during container initialization
# - GH_TOKEN is provided through Codespaces secrets, no need to set it manually
# - The empty .env file is still required for DevContainer runArgs to work properly
#
# IMPORTANT: The actual .env file is in .gitignore to prevent token exposure
